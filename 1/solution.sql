-- 1) Count the customers with grades above Bangalore's Average. 

SELECT * from customer where grade > (SELECT AVG(grade) from customer where city = 'bangalore');

-- 2) Find the name and numbers of all salesmen who had more than one customer.

SELECT
    unique_orders.salesman_id,
    count(unique_orders.salesman_id)
    from (SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, salesman_id from orders) as unique_orders
    group by unique_orders.salesman_id
    having count(unique_orders.salesman_id) > 1;

-- 3) List all salesmen and indicate those who have and donâ€™t have customers in their cities (Use UNION operation.) 

SELECT salesman_name, city, 'True' as HaveCustomer from salesman where city in (SELECT city from customer)
UNION
SELECT salesman_name, city, 'False' as HaveCustomer from salesman where city not in (SELECT city from customer);

--4) Create a view that finds the salesman who has the customer with the highest order of a day.

SELECT ord_date, MAX(purch_amt) from orders group by ord_date;

--5) Demonstrate the DELETE operation by removing salesmen with id 1000. All his orders must also be deleted.
